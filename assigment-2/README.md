# In this assignment you will create the following code:

1. Create a colab script (or a python script on local machine)
1. Find any dataset with more than 5000 samples and target labels
1. Build a fully connected ANN and train it (on GPU) 
1. Build a CNN with MLP on top of it as classifier and train it (on GPU)
1. Compare the results and plot the learning and evaluation curves
1. If you create a Jupyter (colab script) all these figures should be embedded in the script
1. If you are using basic pyhon you should create a document where these figures will be shown
1. In both cases caption and annotation is necessary
